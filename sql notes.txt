CTE - common table expression
creates temporary result sets that can be referenced with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE OR DELETE
useful for breaking down complex queries into more manageable and readable parts
Syntax
WITH cte_name AS (
	SELECT column_1,column_2,...
	FROM your_table
	WHERE some_condition
)

DENSE_RANK() - to calculate dense rank of rows within a result set based on the values in one or more columns, Dense ranking assigns the same rank to the rows with same values and leaves no gaps in ranking
Syntax
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
	PARTITION BY partition_expression
	ORDER BY sort_expression
)

RANK() - to calculate the rank of rows within a result set based on the values in one or more columns. The RANK() FUNCTION assigns a unique rank to each row and handles tied values by assigning the same rank to rows with same values, but the next rank will have a gap if there are tied ranks.

CASE - statement is used to perform conditional logic within a sql query, you can use CASE to evaluate conditions and return different values or actions based on those conditions.
Syntax
CASE
	WHEN condition1 THEN result1
	WHEN condition2 THEN result2
	ELSE else_result
END

TO_CHAR - function is used to convert date, time, and timestamp values into formatted strings

TO_CHAR(source,format)

EXTRACT - function is used to extract specific components such as year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds,etc from date and timestamp values

DATE_TRUNC - function is used to truncate a date or timestamp value to a specific level of precision. It allows you to round down a date or timestamp to a specified unit, such as year, quater, month, week, day, hour, etc
Syntax
DATE_TRUNC(unit, source)

ROUND - function to round a numeric or decimal value to a specified number of decimal places.
Syntax
ROUND(value, decimal_places)

STRING_TO_ARRAY - function used to splite a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter
Syntax
STRING_TO_ARRAY(column_name or input_string, delimiter)

UNNEST - function is used to expand an array into a set of rows. It can be particularly useful when you have an array column and you want to view its elements as separate rows
Syntax
SELECT UNNEST(array_column) AS column_name
FROM your_table;

STRING_AGG - function is used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string, with an optional separator.
Syntax
STRING_AGG(expression, separator)

CONCAT_WS - function is used to concatenate multiple strings or values with a specified delimiter
Syntax
CONCAT_WS(separator, column_name or string1,string2,...)

CONCAT - function is used to concatenate two or more strings into a single string
Syntax
